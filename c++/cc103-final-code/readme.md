# C++ CRUD with Structs and Arrays @ iAmK1ruu

This repository contains a set of C++ files implementing the simple version of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using structs and arrays.

## Features
- Struct-based data management
- Array manipulation for storing and updating records
- Command-line input/output for CRUD operations

## Usage

1. **Download the files**: Clone the repository or download the zip file of the source code.

2. **Compile the C++ files**: Use a C++ compiler to compile the `.cpp` files.

3. **Run the program**: After compiling, execute the program by providing the necessary parameters (if any) in the command prompt.

4. **Perform CRUD operations**: Follow the on-screen instructions to create, read, update, or delete records using the program's interface.

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Basic understanding of running C++ files through the command prompt
